<h1 align="center"> Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ </h1>
I am a second-year Geoinformatics student at Maria Curie-SkÅ‚odowska University in Lublin, with a strong passion for exploring new technologies. I always strive to pursue my own projects and develop my passions further. In my free time, I love playing video games, working out at the gym, reading reportage literature, and enjoying playing the guitar (mainly rock). I am always eager to discover new solutions and take on new challenges.
